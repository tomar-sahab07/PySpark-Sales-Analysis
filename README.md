# End to End PySpark-Sales-Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform sales analysis using PySpark. The objective is to understand the business requirements, define key performance indicators (KPIs), clean and process the provided datasets, and finally analyze and visualize the data to derive insights.

## Business Requirements
The client has provided two datasets: `menu.csv.txt` and `sales.csv.txt`. However, the data is not in the proper format for analysis. The business goal is to grow the business, and to achieve that, we need to clean and process the data to build the following KPIs:
- Total amount spent by each customer
- Total amount spent on each food category
- Total amount of sales in each month
- Yearly sales
- Quarterly sales
- Number of times each product was purchased
- Top 5 ordered items
- Frequency of customer visits to the restaurant
- Total sales by each country
- Total sales by order source

## Project Agenda
1. **Understanding Business Requirements**: Understand the client's objectives and define the KPIs required for analysis.
2. **Understanding Datasets**: Review the provided datasets (`menu.csv.txt` and `sales.csv.txt`) to identify data schema, inconsistencies, and missing values.
3. **Data Cleaning and Processing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and prepare it for analysis.
4. **Practical Analysis on Databricks Notebook**: Perform analysis using PySpark on Databricks notebook, implementing the defined KPIs.
5. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the analyzed data to derive insights and present findings effectively.

## Datasets
- `menu.csv.txt`: Contains information about the menu of food items to be ordered.
- `sales.csv.txt`: Contains sales data.

## Project Structure
- `menu.csv.txt , sales.csv.txt`: Files containing the datasets.
- `Pyspark Sales Analysis Project.ipynb`: File containing PySpark scripts for data cleaning and processing..

## Dependencies
- PySpark
